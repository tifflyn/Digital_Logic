# Network Packet Transmission Monitoring System 
In this project, the user must choose a single digit number of packet data that the user wants to transfer from lab A's computers to lab B's computers. 
Users can control manually the packet data transfer from one of the six computers from lab A to one of the six computers from lab B. Transfer of packet data will 
stop when the number of packet data transferred reaches the number the user has chosen.

After brainstorming with my teammates, we created the simulation as follows

**Reflection:**
This project introduced me about network packet transmission monitoring system, it is an eye opening experience by researching that system and knowing what i knew 
for now is just the tip of the ice-berg. Although the circuit our team created is just a simple circuit compared to the circuit or simulation I researched online, 
there are still challenges to tackle and lessons to learn while working on this project. This indicates that there is still so much more for me to learn and I will 
no doubt feed into the knowledge hunger.
